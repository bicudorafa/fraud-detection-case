# fraud-detection-case
This repository contains a Fraud Detection analysis, model and recommendations fictional use case powered by Google Colab. The notebook covers all ML practice topics such as:
- How to analyse and clean raw data, identify its characteristics and issues (missing data, outliers, misformatting) and how to treat them
- How to execute an Exploratory Data Analysis, identify patterns in the data and formulate some hipothesys about the Data Generation Process
- How to train and assess a new Machine Learning model for Fraud detection, which metrics are more suited for the problem, along with modeling decisions (train, validation and test sets creation, model selection, hyperparmeter tuning and feature selection, model performance analysis)
- How to transform model outputs into decisions and how to estimate its impact in production

## Setp
The notebook was created and run on Google Colab instances, so, to run it locally, just copy it to the Google Colab environmemnt (The CPU run time is able to run most of the notebook, but CPU might be needed to perform some intensive operations.
